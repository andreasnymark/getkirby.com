Title: Refactoring

----

Text:

#### Core

- Throw proper errors when thumbnails cannot be generated 
- Removed `config/blueprints` directory with dead block blueprints and moved default blueprints for site, page and file to in-code arrays in `Kirby\Cms\Core::blueprints()`
- Removed `Kirby\Toolkit\Properties` trait from `Kirby\Api\Api`, `Kirby\Cms\Api`, `Kirby\Email\Email`,  `Kirby\Email\Body`, `Kirby\Cms\Auth\Status`, `Kirby\Cms\App`, `Kirby\Cms\ContentTranslation`, `Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent`, `Kirby\Toolkit\Pagination` , `Kirby\Http\Uri` , `Kirby\Cms\FileVersion`, `Kirby\Filesystem\Asset`, `Kirby\Filesystem\File`, `Kirby\Image\Image` classes and `Kirby\Filesystem\IsFile` trait
- `Kirby\Cms\Language`, `Kirby\Cms\Plugin`, `Kirby\Cms\Role` and `Kirby\Cms\StructureObject` don't extend `Kirby\Cms\Model` (and thus also don't use the `Kirby\Toolkit\Properties` trait) anymore
- `Kirby\Cms\Structure` extends `Kirby\Cms\Items` and `Kirby\Cms\StructureObject` extends `Kirby\Cms\Item`
- New `Content` namespace
  - Moved the `Content`, `ContentTranslation` and `Field` classes into the new namespace (compatibility aliases are provided for now)
  - New internal `ContentStorage` class that currently holds more of the storage related business logic
  - New internal `ContentStorageHandler` interface and internal `PlainTextContentStorageHandler` class to bundle all low-level content logic in one place
- Whoops is now generally disabled during PHPUnit test runs to reduce memory usage during tests

#### Panel

- More frontend unit tests
- Cleaned up `k-toolbar` component
- New drawer component structure:
  ```html
  <k-overlay type="drawer">
    <form class="k-drawer" method="dialog">
      <k-drawer-notification />
      <k-drawer-header />
      <k-drawer-body>
        <k-drawer-fields />
      </k-drawer-body>
    </form>
  </k-overlay>
  ```
- Portals: Dialogs, Drawers and other Overlays are now separated into different portals. This is done by setting the overlay type:
	- `<k-overlay type="dialog">`
	- `<k-overlay type="drawer">`
	- `<k-overlay>`
	An overlay without a type will use the default overlay portal. Separating them into different portals gives us more control over `z-index` and layering of elements.
- Removed `v-model` from `k-form` and `k-fieldset`
- Removed `$listeners` usage from `k-draggable`, `k-button` and subcomponents, `k-link`, `k-headline`, `k-form`, `k-block`, `k-block-title`, `k-box`, `k-image`, `k-content-item`
- Made `k-bubble` more flexible
- Use the Vue object syntax for dynamic `:style` attributes to enhance the robustness and security
- Reduce JS forEach usage
