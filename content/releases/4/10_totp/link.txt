Title: Time-based, one-time passwords

----

Menu: TOTP login

----

Subtitle: Making your Panel even more secure

----

Teaser: Kirby now supports time-based one-time codes (TOTP), offering more secure ways to sign into the Panel. When two-factor authentication is activated, one-time codes from your authenticator app will be used instead of codes via email.

Each user can set up TOTP in the account view in the Panel, adding their secret key to their authenticator app.

----

TotpExample:

```php "site/config/config.php"
return [
    'auth' => [
        'methods' => [
            'password' => ['2fa' => true]
        ]
    ]
];
```
