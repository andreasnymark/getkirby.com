Title: Bug fixes

----

Text:

- Removed flickering from `k-pagination` when navigating
- Fixed name of default blueprints to `pages/default` and `files/default`
- Blocks: batch selection allows deselecting blocks
- Blocks: batch selection gets deselected on Escape key
- Fixed i18n translate issues, e.g. for the user blueprint title [#4869](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4869)
- Writer field: Email mark toolbar button title is properly translated now
- Empty required Writer field now shows proper invalid styling in Panel
- UUIDs are less often generated when not needed to be generated
- Kirby queries now differentiate between integers and floats as arguments
- Kirby no longer hides errors in the response class when the response is converted to a string [#5027](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/5027#issuecomment-1446830047)
- Files field upload: use `upload.parent` for mime check [#5245](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/5245)
- `$field->toUrl()` will return `null` on empty fields [#5259](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/5259)
- Users field does not use a default anymore if none set
- The "Session ... is currently read-only because it was accessed via an old session" error is circumvented when the PHP `sodium` extension is available
- Removed the error boundary from `<k-fieldset>`; the error boundary kills the entire field/input if an error occurs, which is way too aggressive and also makes it more difficult to handle errors properly.
- `App::multilang()` and `App::defaultLanguage()` are correctly updated on changes to language data [#5342](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/5342)
- Prevent unnecessary runs in `Language::update()` when updating the default language
- Block title: certain HTML characters are now properly unescaped in the label [#5346](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/5346)
