Title: Page creation dialogs

----

Menu: Page dialog

----

Subtitle: Faster, better page creation

----

Teaser:

Customize the page creation dialog to your needs.

Give the title a fitting label, add new fields or disable redirecting to the new page. Did we mention you can also define the initial page status after creation now?

----

Example:

```yaml
title: Product
create:
  title:
    label: Product name
  fields:
    - price
    - brand
  redirect: false
  status: listed
```
