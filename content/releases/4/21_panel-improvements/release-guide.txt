#### Dialogs for fields

Fields can now define their own dialogs on the backend:

- Fields with array definition:
  ```php
  return [
    'props' => [
      // ...
    ],
    'dialogs' => function () {
      return [
        [
          'pattern' => 'delete',
          'load' => function () {},
          'submit' => function () {},
        ]
      ];
    }
  ];
  ```
	<br>
- Field classes:
  ```php
  class MyField extends FieldClass
  {
    public function dialogs(): array
    {
      return [
        [
          'pattern' => 'delete',
          'load' => function () {},
          'submit' => function () {},
        ]
      ];
    }
  }
  ```

The route patterns for field dialogs are automatically prefixed with the following scheme:

```php
dialogs/$modelPath/fields/$fieldName/$pattern
```

Here's an example:

```php
dialogs/pages/blog/fields/blocks/delete
```

In a field component, the dialog can be opened by using the field endpoint:

```js
this.$dialog(this.endpoints.field + "/delete")
```

#### Customization of the layout selector

The layout selector is now customizable with the `size` (`small`, `medium`, `large`, `huge`) and `columns` options via the new `selector` prop:

```yaml
layout:
  type: layout
  layouts:
    ...
  selector:
    # `small`, `medium`, `large` or `huge`
    size: huge
    columns: 6
```

### More improvements

- Disabled buttons can receive focus (tab) which allows them to be read out by screenreaders.
- Structure fields donâ€™t disregard content changes anymore when clicking outside the form (now drawer).
- Correct autofocus handling for blocks, layout, structure, picker fields and dropdowns
- Improved focus styles for links and the flag preview in tables
- All minified panel assets now add `.min` to the filename. This will avoid auto-minification in Cloudflare and possibly other environments.
- Improved text overflow behavior for links in tables
- Increase the font size for help text in sections and fields
- The multiselect and tag dropdowns now offer more space to not cut off longer options.
- Slug field: respect custom slug allowlist from the `Str` class
- Pages section: new `templatesIgnore` option [#5322](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/5322)
- Users field: set `default: true` to always use the currently logged in user as default
- New items size `full`

#### And so much more

We've tweaked the Panel extensively with too many improvements to name them all. But here are some more:

- Load Panel area views dynamically with the new `when` prop
- Each Panel area can now define additional requests for simple data endpoints or actions
- Syntax highlighting in the `k-code` with Prism
- Text fields: new `font: monospace` option
- `panel.css` and `panel.js` config options now also support arrays with multiple entries as well as absolute URLs
- `k-pagination` can always be navigated by keys (no extra prop needed anymore)
- Notifications: support for custom icons
- `k-tag` supports an image/icon frame
- New `disabled` property for the `k-options-dropdown` component
- New `selected` property for `k-button` to set the `aria-selected` attribute
