Title: Bug fixes

----

Text:

- Fixed thumb issues resulting from EXIF orientation entry [#2695](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/2695)
- Model hooks for actions: multiple hooks don't overwrite each others' changes to the model [#6460](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6460) [#2828](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/2828)
- Headers with null as value are no longer added to JS API requests. [#6435](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6435)
- `$helper.object.clone` is no longer deprecated. Please use it instead of `structuredClone` as this might cause issues down the road with Vue 3. [#6479](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6479)
- Kirby is better at removing failed file uploads from the server tmp directory [#2476](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/2476)
- Canceling the file upload dialog now also cancels ongoing uploads [#6421](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6421)
- `<k-header>`: fixed wrapping with many buttons in narrow screens [#6544](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6544)
- Fixed query support for default values in fields [#2814](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/2814) [#2815](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/2815)
- Panel search now also considers site files [#6710](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6710)
- The lock state is properly passed to `k-file-preview` components to make sure that file previews can lock their state (e.g. for the focus point for image previews)
- Fixed badge position in model tabs and improved CSS for button badges in general
- Fixed background CSS for the `k-progress` component
