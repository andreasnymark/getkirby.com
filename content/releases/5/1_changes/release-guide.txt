Teaser:

In Kirby 5, so-called unsaved changes are no longer limited to your browser. Instead, they're immediately stored on the server, unlocking new possibilities: share your changes with others, preview your changes before publishing them, and start collaborating. This makes teamwork smoother—colleagues can review or edit changes without affecting live content. Whether you're at your desk or on the go, you can pick up right where you or your team left off.

The new Panel preview view allows you to compare your published page and new changes side-by-side. Or share a link with others to preview any changes before they are published.

## Versions: Preview your changes

Kirby 5 introduces a part of one of the (link: https://feedback.getkirby.com/135 text: most requested features) on our feedback platform. Editors can now make changes and get a full, rendered preview right from the Panel before they save them. They can share the URL for the preview of the unpublished changes with other editors and people in their team to get feedback.

The brand new changes view lets you switch between a comparison mode or a full-width preview of the changed version and the latest published version.

The new preview view for pages and the site is located at `/panel/pages/(:any)/changes/(changes|latest|compare)` and `/panel/site/changes/(changes|latest|compare)`.

It can be accessed with the new preview dropdown for the site and pages.

… or through the page context menu …

Get more details about the changes for the current page, file or user, by accessing the new info dropdown next to the form buttons:

This dropdown will also show more information when the content is locked because another editor is currently working on it.

All changes by everyone in the team - not just the current editor - are now listed in the Changes dialog (accessible via the “Changes” menu item in the sidebar) and grouped by type (page, user, file). Now everyone in the team can directly use the dialog to jump to changes by other team members and preview them directly on the fly, even while someone else is still actively working on them.

We’ve also improved the language dropdown to highlight changes in different translations.

With all of those features built on top of our new content version architecture, Kirby 5 starts a path to full revision support in the future. We have already laid the foundations and are looking forward to extending the feature set over time.
