With a handful of early adopters, we've been working behind the scenes to finally make something come true that had been planned for a long time: our **Kirby Partner directory**.

Today is also the day you've all been waiting for: Here comes the **Kirby 4 Alpha pre-release**. We are deliberately calling it an Alpha to emphasize that Kirby 4 is neither feature complete nor ready for production, and there will definitely still be many changes until the final release – and plenty of bugs. But we want to give you the chance to get your hands on the game early and are excited to hear your feedback.

But read on below:


## Partner directory

Today marks the beginning of something great for developers, designers and their future clients: We are launching the [Kirby Partner directory](https://getkirby.com/partners) !

For you as developers/designers, this directory presents an opportunity to demonstrate your Kirby and web development expertise to a large, growing audience.

For clients all over the world, it is vital to have partners who know Kirby well, create great websites or apps, and provide high-quality services, in short, to be reassured there is always someone to trust with their Kirby project.

## Kirby 4 Alpha pre-release

Kirby 4 is all about a new editing experience for users. With new field types and views, a way to move pages, customizable page create dialogs, query support for sections, options and enhancements for the textarea, writer, blocks and layouts fields, and cool image editing improvements, using the Panel is now more impressive than ever. Here are just a few of the highlights waiting for you(and we are not done yet, more is planned for the release in late summer).

### Link field
Link to anything

### Language editor
No longer lost in translation

### New search view
Deliver results
