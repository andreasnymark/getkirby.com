Sonja is currently on vacation and we are filling in for her, so please bear with us if the tone of this Kosmos issue sounds a bit different üòä.

## Releases

We are returning from the ominous ‚Äúsummer hole‚Äù with a bunch of releases:

### Kirby 4.4

[Kirby 4.4](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.4.0) comes with tons of new enhancements and bug fixes.

Unfortunately, we also managed to sneak in a few smaller bugs and there‚Äôs already a [patch release](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.4.1) available for those.

### Kirby 5.0.0-alpha.3

While Kirby 5 is still months away, we want to make development as public as possible and get you involved early. Today we are releasing [Kirby 5.0.0-alpha.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/5.0.0-alpha.3), which brings custom file previews, a configurable first day of the week, and many other improvements. This release is rough around the edges and far from complete. Don't use it in production.

### KQL 2.2.0

Our Kirby Query Language plugin is a fantastic way to use Kirby as a headless CMS. We released [KQL 2.2.0](https://github.com/getkirby/kql/releases/tag/2.2.0) a few weeks ago and it now fully supports PHP 8.3 (but drops support for PHP 8.0).

## Podcasts
Alex & Dominik from the (German) [devslove.it](http://devslove.it/) podcast invited Georg Obermayr to their show. You may remember Georg from the infamous [Stay Curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zrgqExDS68) webinar years ago where he talked about the mindblowing headless setup that he built.

Together they recorded three really interesting episodes talking about Kirby and content management in general. The episodes turned out great and are well worth your time.

1.  [Content Modelling & klarer CMS-Aufbau](https://rss.com/podcasts/devslove-it-der-podcast/1600171/)
2.  [Speed Snack](https://rss.com/podcasts/devslove-it-der-podcast/1600172/)
3.  [Warum die Community f√ºr ein CMS wichtig ist](https://rss.com/podcasts/devslove-it-der-podcast/1600173/)

Bruno has launched a brand new directory of sites, built with Kirby: [builtwithkirby.com](https://builtwithkirby.com/) for his new [Performance Audit Service](https://audit.bnomei.com/).

Together with Thomas‚Äô [Kirby Sites](https://kirbysites.com/) project and our own [showcase](https://getkirby.com/love) there are now three fantastic ways to get inspired by all your wonderful Kirby sites out there.

## New themes

## Tools

The indie developer community needs to stick together and today we want to send you a recommendation for a fantastic little invoicing tool called [CakeDesk](https://cakedesk.app/). We know of a number of freelancers in our community who are happy CakeDesk users. The biggest selling point is probably the HTML based template system for invoices. Be sure to check it out if you are in the market for a new invoicing tool.
