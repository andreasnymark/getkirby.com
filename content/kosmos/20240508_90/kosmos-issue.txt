Nevertheless, we have some hot news for you in this issue, and it's not just about the sales...

## Kirby 5 alpha


(image: cover.png link: https://getkirby.com/buzz/v5-alpha)

Today we are sharing the very first alpha version of our new major version, Kirby 5 with you. As an alpha, this version is **far from complete** yet, so **things will still change**, and we will also **add new features** until the release at the end of this year.

Here is an overview of the very first new features:

### Dark mode: turn off the lights

The most notable change is a dark mode for the Panel, a feature requested by many of you. Users can now activate a dark theme for the Panel from their account view.

### More features

*   Custom view button extension for the Panel header

*   Improved support for IDE autocompletion
*   The \`default\` prop of radio and select fields now supports Kirby queries
*   \`site\` controller data will now always be merged as default data with data from page template specific controllers
*   â€¦

Check out our [blog article](https://getkirby.com/buzz/v5-alpha) which summarizes all current features, enhancement, and breaking changes.

And [download](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/archive/refs/tags/5.0.0-alpha.1.zip) the Kirby 5 alpha for testing and playing around.

As always, we are looking forward to your feedback to fix any issues.



## Kirby 4.3.0 is here

Next to our work on Kirby 5, we continue with minor releases for Kirby 4.

Last week, we released Kirby 4.3.0 with quite useful new features, enhancements and fixes, for example:

*   The system view now has a button to copy relevant system information.
*   We removed the hard-coded restriction of supported servers, so no additional settings needed anymore if you are not on Apache or nginx.
*   The plugin registration now accepts named arguments that are merged with info from composer.json, so you can set the version number in the plugin definition.

Check out the full changelog under: [https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.3.0](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.3.0)



## Kirby plugins

The new [Kirby CSV field plugin](https://github.com/distantnative/kirby-csv-field) provides a Panel field to upload and display a single CSV file.


[Kirby Policy](https://plugins.getkirby.com/beebmx/policy) allows you to show different fields in the Panel, depending on user role.
