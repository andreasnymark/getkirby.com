In our part of the world, summer has already started and everyone is preparing for their summer vacations. But we are still busy…

While we are working hard on the next big Kirby 4 release [(Kirby 4 Alpha
3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.0.0-alpha.3) was released 2 week ago), Kirby 3 is still under active development. Also two weeks ago we released [Kirby 3.9.5](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.5) with many bug fixes and some improvements, and the next Kirby 3 version is already in the works.

## From the Kirbyverse

"So yes, as you might have noticed by now, I am a big fan of Kirby, especially because it allows you to solve common problems in a straightforward way, making my life as a designer and developer so much easier, but also because my clients have always been very happy with the content editing experience in the backend â without exception. Kirby enables successful projects." (from [Starting A New Kirby Project](https://matthiasott.com/notes/starting-a-new-kirby-project))
