Title: EULA 2024-11-12: Summary of changes

----

Intro:

After recent events in the CMS industry, members of the Kirby community reached out with questions about the legal interaction between developers of Kirby extensions (plugins and themes) and us, the Content Folder GmbH & Co. KG developing Kirby. We always intended to support extension developers in a pragmatic way and thus updated the EULA to reflect this in writing.

As all changes are in your favor, the updated terms become binding by publication on the Kirby website for all Kirby 4+ licenses.

In particular, we have changed the following:

----

Text:

## Your rights

- We now allow to copy and adapt individual parts of Kirby's source code for use in Kirby plugins and themes as long as a code comment referencing our copyright and this license is used (see the (link: license/2024-11-12#restrictions__extraction-of-source-code-parts text: full EULA text) for details).

## Free licenses

- We removed the license type "Extension Demo" that allowed to use Kirby without an activated license to showcase Kirby plugins and themes. We made this change because this license type did not fit with the license implementation in the Kirby Panel (there was no way to correctly disable the activation banner). Instead, we will grant free licenses to all extension (plugin and theme) developers on request. Please get in touch at <support@getkirby.com>. Extension Demos that were set up before November 12, 2024 are unaffected by this change and can keep their unactivated license as granted by the (link: license/2023-11-28#free-licenses__usage-for-an-extension-demo text: previous EULA version).
- We added a new section for free licenses on request that describes our existing practice.

## Clarifications

- It was already allowed to copy and adapt the MIT-licensed parts of Kirby's source code. We have now converted this clause into its own section in the EULA and added the full MIT license terms.
- We updated the EULA summary to make clearer how free licenses work.
- We clarified that licenses don't need to be activated to the development domain(s) of the project.
- We adapted the structure and copy throughout the EULA to the new changes. These editorial changes don't change the general meaning of the EULA.
