## Importing data

If you have the data from your old CMS in a structured format of any kind, you can turn it into Kirby pages, users or files. 

(screencast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWa_cmbuxLw poster: screencast.jpg title: How to import data into Kirby text: In this video you will learn how to use the Kirby CLI to create pages from a dataset. No matter if you are importing data from an existing CMS, a JSON API, an Excel sheet or any other source – this tutorial will provide a good foundation.)
