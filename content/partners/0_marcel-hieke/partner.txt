Description:

With over 15 years of experience in the web industry, I have cultivated a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of various domains. Throughout my career, I have successfully developed custom applications and websites tailored to meet the unique needs of a wide range of clients. My expertise extends beyond standard technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**; I am also proficient in frameworks like Kirby and **Laravel**, and I utilize **Vue.js** to create dynamic, state-driven, and highly interactive front-end experiences.

My primary focus lies in crafting robust PHP-based web applications and websites. For several years, I have had the privilege of assisting companies and NGOs in their digital transformation journeys, helping them streamline work processes and enhance their internal structures through effective technology solutions.

I am a passionate advocate for open-source software and believe in the power of community collaboration. I actively seek opportunities to contribute to open-source projects, particularly those related to Kirby, as I value the innovation and shared knowledge that arise from such efforts.

I invite you to reach out if you would like to learn more about my work or discuss potential collaborations. I look forward to connecting!
