Description:

ZENTRALNORDEN Kreativgesellschaft mbH is a Berlin-based design and consulting agency specialized in brand development and brand communication. 

For 14 years, ZENTRALNORDEN has been convincing its clients with design products from conception to implementation of brand identities in digital, analog and spatial form. The strong empathic attitude towards clients and their challenges as well as target groups enables tailor-made and measurable successes, including various design awards.

As a design agency, ZENTRALNORDEN offers its clients holistic support from strategy and design to technical development. The methodical approach forms the basis for workshops, target group interviews, content or tonality. The agency develops UX concepts, “look and feels” and corporate designs, which are transferred to the UI design of the digital project. At the same time, written and visual content is developed with the clients - texts, illustrations or even animation. The technical implementation is strongly oriented towards user needs and ultimately results in a user-friendly digital project for all involved.
